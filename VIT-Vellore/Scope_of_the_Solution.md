  Scope of the Solution

---

- Detect hazardous conditions such as gas leaks or fire using:
  - MQ2 Gas Sensor to detect smoke or flammable gases.
  - Ambient Light Sensor (used as flame sensor) to detect sudden light intensity changes indicating fire.
  
- Provide real-time alerts using:
  - Buzzer to sound an alarm when danger is detected.
  - 16x2 LCD Display to show live sensor values and danger warnings.

- Display current sensor readings (gas/smoke and light) continuously on LCD.

- Automate emergency detection without human intervention to ensure quick response.

- Simulate the system using Tinkercad Circuits (no hardware needed for testing).

- Ensure the solution is cost-effective, easy to deploy, and suitable for small to mid-sized industries.
