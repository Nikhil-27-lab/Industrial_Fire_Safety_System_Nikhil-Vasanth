In industrial environments, fire and gas leak accidents pose a serious threat to both life and infrastructure. Traditional safety systems often rely on manual monitoring, which may delay emergency response. This project aims to design and implement a microcontroller-based Industrial Fire Safety System that can automatically detect the presence of smoke, gas, or fire and alert personnel using visual and audio indicators.

The system utilizes an MQ2 gas sensor to detect smoke or flammable gases and an ambient light sensor as a substitute for a flame sensor to identify fire or sudden light changes. Upon detection of hazardous conditions, the system activates a buzzer alarm and displays real-time alerts and sensor values on a 16x2 LCD screen. The entire solution is simulated using Tinkercad, making it accessible for development without physical hardware.

This automated solution enhances worker safety and enables faster evacuation during emergencies, aligning with modern industry standards for smart safety systems.
