#  Required Components to Develop the Solution

---

##  Hardware Components:

- Arduino Uno microcontroller board
- MQ2 Gas Sensor (for smoke/gas detection)
- Ambient Light Sensor (used as flame detector substitute)
- 16x2 LCD Display (to show sensor values and alerts)
- Buzzer (for sound alert)
- 10kÎ© Potentiometer (for LCD contrast adjustment)
- Breadboard
- Jumper wires (male-to-male)
- USB A to B cable (for programming Arduino)

##  Software Requirements:

- **Arduino IDE**
  - Used to write and upload code to Arduino Uno

- **Tinkercad Circuits**
  - Used to simulate the entire hardware circuit without physical components

---

##  Optional Tools (Software):

- **Fritzing**
  - For creating circuit diagrams and generating Gerber files
