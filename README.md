# Industrial Fire Safety System

## Overview
This project is an **Industrial Fire Safety System** designed to detect and alert in case of a fire or gas leak within industrial environments. The system uses an MQ2 gas sensor and an ambient light sensor (as a substitute for a flame sensor) to monitor environmental conditions. When dangerous thresholds are detected, the system triggers a buzzer alert and displays warning messages using a 16x2 LCD.

## Getting Started
To build and simulate this project, follow the setup steps below using Tinkercad or physical hardware.

---

## Hardware Requirements
- Arduino Uno microcontroller  
- MQ2 Gas Sensor  
- Ambient Light Sensor (flame substitute)  
- 16x2 LCD Display  
- Buzzer  
- 10kŒ© Potentiometer (for LCD contrast)  
- Breadboard  
- Jumper wires  
- USB A to B Cable

---

## Software Requirements
- Arduino IDE  
- Tinkercad Circuits (for simulation)  

---

## Installation
1. Connect the hardware components as per the circuit diagram in the `Circuit/` folder.
2. Open the Arduino code file (`fire_safety_system.ino`) from the `Code/` directory.
3. Upload the code to the Arduino Uno using Arduino IDE.
4. Power the microcontroller ‚Äì the system starts automatically.

---

## Usage
- The system continuously reads values from the **MQ2 Gas Sensor** and **Ambient Light Sensor**.
- If smoke levels (MQ2) are above 500 **or** light level drops below 300 (indicating fire):
  - Buzzer sounds an alert.
  - LCD displays "ALERT!" along with sensor values.
- If safe, the LCD simply shows real-time sensor values without alert.
